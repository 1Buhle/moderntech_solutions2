Page Overview

The application follows a logical flow, starting with user authentication and leading to various HR management modules.

 LoginView.php

This is the initial entry point of the application. It handles user authentication, verifying credentials against a stored password and managing user sessions. Upon successful login, the user is redirected to the Dashboard.

 Dashboard.View.php

The Dashboard serves as the central hub for the HR system, providing a summary of key HR metrics. It displays information such as:

  * Total present and absent employees.
  * Total denied and pending leave requests.
  * Employee information including department, salary, and employment history.
  * Weekly hours data for employees.

 Employee\_Directory.php

This page manages employee records within the system. It provides functionalities for:

  * Adding new employees: Inputting details such as name, position, department, salary, employment history, contact, and photo.
  * Editing existing employee details**: Updating any of the employee's attributes.
  * Deleting employee records: Removing an employee from the directory.
  * Searching employees: Filtering employee records by name.

Payroll.php

The Payroll page is responsible for calculating and managing employee payroll. It fetches and aggregates data related to:

  * Employee information (ID, name, position, department, salary, employment history).
  * Attendance data for a defined pay period to determine hours worked.
  * Approved leave requests to apply deductions.
    The page is designed to process payroll based on these factors, displaying a summary and allowing for payslip downloads.

 AttendanceView.php

This page is dedicated to managing employee attendance records. It supports the following operations:

  * Adding attendance: Recording an employee's presence or absence for a specific date. It includes a check to prevent duplicate entries for the same employee on the same day.
  * Updating attendance: Modifying existing attendance records.
  * Deleting attendance: Removing attendance entries.

PerformanceReviewView.php

This module allows for the management of employee performance reviews. Key features include:

  * Adding employees for review: Registering an employee with an initial performance score.
  * Editing performance details: Updating an employee's name or performance score.
  * Deleting performance records: Removing performance review entries.

LeaveView.php

The Leave Request Management page facilitates the process of handling employee leave requests. It provides functionalities for:

  * Submitting leave requests: Employees can submit new requests with specified start and end dates, and a reason. Requests are initially set to a 'Pending' status.
  * Viewing leave requests: Displaying all submitted leave requests, including employee names and their current status.
  * Updating leave status: HR personnel can approve, deny, or change the status of pending leave requests.
  * Deleting leave requests: Removing leave request entries.

 Common Components

Sidebar.php

The `Sidebar.php` component provides a consistent navigation menu across all pages except the `LoginView.php`. 
It dynamically adjusts based on the user's session and provides links to different sections of the HR system, such as Dashboard, Employee Directory, Payroll, Attendance, Performance Review, and Leave Request. 
It also displays the logged-in user's name and profile picture.

Footer.php

The `Footer.php` component is included at the bottom of every page, except for the `LoginView.php`. 
It typically contains consistent information and branding elements, such as links to social media (e.g., Facebook, GitHub, Twitter) and copyright information.

Database Connection

All pages interact with a MySQL database named `moderntech_hr` using a `root` user and a defined password. 
Database connection details are configured in `config.php` (not provided in the files, but referenced). 
The system uses PDO for database interactions in some pages (e.g., `AttendanceView.php`, `PerformanceReviewView.php`, `Employee_Directory.php`) and `mysqli` in others (e.g., `LeaveView.php`, `Dashboard.View.php`, `Payroll.php`).
